# Digital-Twin

Key Performance Indicators (KPIâ€™s) are essential for decision making in any Chemical process plant. With digitalization, new challenges are faced as the complexity of the process plant increases. In such cases, the performance indicators are generally calculated using deeper analytics technology such as digital twin. In this work, the term digital twin is defined with regard to a jacketed Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor. A simulation dataset is created using the steady-state model. Then, a highly detailed dynamic reactor model is presented. Furthermore, the model is optimized using Neural Networks, in order to compensate for the simulation errors. The focus of this work is on modeling and predicting the reactant concentration at different temperatures.
